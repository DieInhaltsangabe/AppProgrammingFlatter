  "firstStepText": "We start by solving the white edges. Of course, you can start with any other color, but in this tutorial we take the white side as an example. We already know that the center stones always stay in the same place. Therefore, we have to make sure that the second color of the edges also matches the center stones of the middle side. This step is intuitive and relatively easy, as there are not yet so many solved stones to pay attention to. In many cases, you just have to turn the edges into their solved state.",

  "secondStepText": "After solving the white edges, we complete the white face with the corners. This step is once again intuitive to solve, and you should not memorize any specific algorithms. However, if you encounter difficulties solving the white corners, here is a simple algorithm that you repeat until the corner is solved: Bring the corner to the position it should be (Front-Right-Top) and repeat the above algorithm until the corner is solved. This algorithm repeatedly swaps the piece between the two dark marked places, changing its orientation in the process.",

  "thirdStepText": "Now that we've solved the white side, we turn it downward as we no longer need it. Up to this point, solving the cube has been relatively easy and intuitive, but that changes now. Many people get stuck at this point because the algorithm to solve the second layer is often repeated four times before the second layer is solved. We now need to learn two algorithms that are symmetric to each other. The right algorithm brings the edge from Front-Top to Front-Right position, while the left one brings the Front-Top edge to Front-Left position. If there are no edges on the top side, you need to bring them out first. Use the same algorithm for this. Afterward, you can insert the edge as usual.",

  "fourthStep": "Yellow Side",
  "fourthStepText": "In the fourth step, we form a yellow cross on the yellow side. It is possible that the second color of an edge does not match that of the middle side, but that's okay because we will solve this in the next step. In this step, all yellow edges are oriented after all other edges are solved. These cases may arise. Use the following algorithms to solve the cases. Dot - If we have this case where no edge is oriented, we must execute the algorithm three times. Make sure to hold the cube correctly after this step, as the next case requires a different position. L-Case - Now we just need to execute the algorithm twice. Make sure that the oriented edges are at the back and left. (There is also an algorithm to go directly to the solved cross: F U R U' R' F'). Line - Execute the algorithm once more to complete the cross. Cross - The cross is finished, and you can proceed to the next step.",

  "fifthStep": "Correct Position of Edges",
  "fifthStepText": "We now have the yellow cross on the upper face, but the side colors of the edges still do not match those of the sides. We must now bring them to the correct position. To bring them to the right place, we use an algorithm that swaps the Front-Top and Left-Top edge: R U R' U R U2 R' U. In some cases, two opposite edges need to be swapped. For this, the algorithm must be executed twice. You need to run the algorithm once, then bring the edges back to the correct position before executing it again.",
  "changeCorners": "Swapping Corners",
  "sixthStep": "All in Position",
  "sixthStepText": "We're almost there. Only the yellow corners are left to solve the cube. We also solve the corners in two steps. First, we will bring the corners to the right position, and then we will orient them in the next step. U R U' L' U R' U' L This algorithm swaps three corners counterclockwise. The Front-Right-Top corner remains in place. When you reach this point in the solution, look for a corner in the correct position. If you find one, hold it Front-Right. Now, execute the algorithm, and if the corners are not in the right position yet, execute it again. If none of the corners is in the correct position, you need to execute the algorithm once. After that, at least one corner is definitely in the right position.",
  "turnCorners": "Corner Orientation",
  "seventhStep": "Last Step",
  "seventhStepText": "In the final step, every piece is in the position it should be, but the yellow corners are still oriented incorrectly. To solve the cube, we need to use the same algorithm we used to solve the corners of the first layer. At the beginning, hold a twisted corner in the Front-Right-Top position. Now, repeat the R' D' R D algorithm until the yellow color is facing up. Then, turn the top layer until another unsolved corner is in the marked area and repeat the R' D' R D algorithm again until the corner is solved. Repeat this process with all the remaining corners until all corners are solved.",

  "notationText": "To start with the notation, let's take the cube from a reference face (for example, white, green, red); we will see that we have six turns: right, left, up, down, front, and finally back face. If you find the letter alone, the turn is clockwise, and if it carries an apostrophe, the turn is counterclockwise. Each letter refers to a layer, and they are in English. U (up): Upper layer (white face) D (down): Lower layer (yellow side) R (right): Right layer (red face) L (left): Left layer (orange face) F (front): Front layer (green face) B (back): Back layer (blue face) With these acronyms, we have already referenced all the basic layers. Now we need to consider that all layers can have different turns; for example, the top layer can have the following turns. Clockwise: U, Counterclockwise: U', Double turn: U2",
